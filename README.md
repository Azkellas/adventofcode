This repository contains my answers for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) events.
Most if not all days were done with the sole purpose of finding the answer as fast as possible, without ever touching the code again afterwards.
As such, they contain very crude, uncommented, non-idiomatic code. The viewer is advised against reading them, as this repository acts more like an archive.

Years 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were done (almost) entirely in python.
Years 2016, 2017 and 2018 were only skimmed over.

Year 2022 will be done in Rust.
